Code Related to my PhD Research.

In general I'm researching optimal designs for additive manufacturing with a focus on using topology optimization. The main focus of my research is on mulit-material optimization. Some additive manufacturing processes can change the composition of the material being deposited while they actually printing! ie. one nozzle with 2 filaments going into it. If we can change the composition on the fly, then how do we model an object in order to find the optimal topology (outer shape and inner holes) and the volume fraction composition at each point in 3D space?
